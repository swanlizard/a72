## VERSION 1.05C

- Because the name A72 was boring and because down the road this is all just preparations for a resident assembler to be put on a ROM chip in a 6502 homebrew computer, I have renamed it **RA** (for "**R**esident **A**ssembler" or "R-Assembler" for ego purposes).
- In connection to the above, untested (!!!) native versions of the core for the 8080 and 6502 are included (each in their own folder now, renamed to .ASM for syntax highlighting).  Each of them AS IS.  They are UNTESTED and I put them here because I don't know when I'll be doing more work on them or when I'll be able to test them.
- The code has comments now for readability and didactic purposes.
- There is now an option to output a symbol file.
- Said symbol file can now be used with the disassembler to reincorporate symbols on disassembly.
