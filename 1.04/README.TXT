CHANGES IN VERSION 1.04

- Bug fixes I forgot to keep track of (a lot of the fixes were incidental to rewriting parts of the program)
- Listings can now be generated, albeit without headers and page counts (trivial to add, though)
- Segment prefixes may now be used inside of brackets (e.g. [DS:BX] and [ES:DI+BP])
- Rewrote sections of program, fixed G6 bug (the only fix I remember off the top of my head)
- More flexible command line parser (throw switches at it in any order)
- Changed all messages to upper case (for a more CP/M-like feel)
- Reformatted source program listing (for aesthetic reasons)
- Parser now treats commas as spaces (again)
